# Problem Definition
In 2019, Spotify held a Datathon which's task was to predict whether Spotify user will skip last song of their listening session. The data provided by Spotify contains two  distinct datasets:
* 10,000 Listening Sessions
+ 50,704 different tracks 


Our response variable is a Boolean which means this is a binary classification problem.

# Data Preparation
1. Merging Datasets: The first part of our Data Prepro- cessing step was to combine both of our User Log and Track Meta data-sets using their linking feature "track_id". After combining these two data-sets, our final data-set ended up having a total of 167,880 rows and 50 columns.

2. Categorical Variables: Next was to tackle our categori- cal features. All 7 categorical features were One-hot Encoded due to the fact that they had no ordinal characteristics. After One-hot Encoding our 7 categorical features, we had a complete data-set of 167,880 rows and 69 columns.

3. Feature Scaling: Features from our Track Meta ranged from decimal values to values as high as 100,therefore, we decided to scale them to values within [0,1].

4.Data Balance: Our data-set does not seem to be severely unbalanced. Figures below show the balance of both our training and testing set, therefore no re-balancing techniques were performed.
