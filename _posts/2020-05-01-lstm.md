# Problem Definition
In 2019, Spotify held a Datathon which's task was to predict whether Spotify user will skip last song of their listening session. The data provided by Spotify contains two  distinct datasets:
* 10,000 Listening Sessions
+ 50,704 different tracks 


Our response variable is a Boolean which means this is a binary classification problem.

## The Data

# Data Preparation
1. **Merging Datasets:** The first part of our Data Prepro- cessing step was to combine both of our User Log and Track Meta data-sets using their linking feature "track_id". After combining these two data-sets, our final data-set ended up having a total of 167,880 rows and 50 columns.

2. **Categorical Variables:** Next was to tackle our categori- cal features. All 7 categorical features were One-hot Encoded due to the fact that they had no ordinal characteristics. After One-hot Encoding our 7 categorical features, we had a complete data-set of 167,880 rows and 69 columns.

3. **Feature Scaling:** Features from our Track Meta ranged from decimal values to values as high as 100,therefore, we decided to scale them to values within [0,1].

4. **Data Balance:** Our data-set does not seem to be severely unbalanced. Figures below show the balance of both our training and testing set, therefore no re-balancing techniques were performed.

# Methods
Overall my network consists of 4 different networks with 4 different inputs: *Previous Session Logs, Previous Session Track Meta, Previous Skip Sequence, and Last Session Position Track Meta*. All four of these inputs will have their own network and I will concatenate them to predict whether the last session position will be skipped.

## Inputs 
1. **Previous Session Logs:** An (19, 35) array that includes all session information leading up to our last session position. 

2. **Previous Session Positions Track Meta:** An (19,31) array contains all information of tracks listened in session positions < Last Position.

3. **Previous Session Positions Skip Sequence:** This input is a sequence of 0s and 1s depicting whether tracks were skipped in previous session positions, this input is a (19,1) array. Since we have varying session lengths, we decided to pad the beginning of the sequence with the value "9". We decided to pad with a value other than 0 due to the fact that in our data, the number 0 means "skipped" and padding our sequences with 0 could alter the performance.
$$x1, x2, ..., x10, x11, ..., x19$$

4. **Last Session Position Track Meta:** Lastly, our fourth input contains all meta information of the track being played in the last session . This is the track for which we are ultimately trying to predict whether the user will skip or not. This is the only input in our model that does not contain any temporal variables.
