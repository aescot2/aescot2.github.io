Welcome! 

My name is Ana Escoto-Cardenas and I am an aspiring Data Scientist, experienced in Python and SQL programming. I am a first generation Mexican American, born and raised in Chicago's south side. I am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) with an expected graduation date of May 2021. As a master student, I am currently conducting research in the OPLEX research lab. My research interests include Process Improvement and Machine Learning. Apart from academics, my hobbies include travelling and most recently, rollerblading. 

I received my Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Industrial Engineering at UIC in 2016. After graduation, I was out in industry for 3 years. I had the opportunity to take on various roles such as: Material Analyst, Quality Engineer, and Manufacturing Supervisor in the aerospace sector. Through these roles, I quickly realized the importance of making data-driven decions and decided to return to school to pursue my passion for data.
